&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young people are less likely to have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. However, it may be common to live in a household with a vulnerable person. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this post, I try to get an estimate for the percentage of people living in a household where at least one person has a condition that makes them at higher risk of serious complications from coronavirus.^[Based on this [list](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fgroups-at-higher-risk.html) from the CDC)] Halfway though working on it, I realized my approach was flawed. However, the flaw is kind of interesting, so I thought it was worth writing up.

## Data


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most surveys ask questions to only one person in the household.^[If you've ever been surveyed, they often ask you to give the phone to the person with the nearest birthday as a way of making sure people who answer the phone aren't the only one's surveyed. Lately, that's probably uncommon as more sophisticated surveys call cell phones and sample off the voter file (so they ask for a specific person if they call the landline).] However, we need to know information about each person living in a household to estimate the number of people who live with someone vulnerable to covid. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get this household level information, I turned to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). This survey asks a number of questions about health conditions to the head of household and (if there is one) spouse, and contains basic information about everyone else living with the household.^[It actually doesn't include non-family members who don't share most household expenses, so I think a roommate who you only split the expense of rent and utilities with wouldn't qualify. There is a question about how many people are living in the household so I can check to see how big of an exclusion that is.]

## Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To estimate the health conditions of other household members, I used the data for people I did have health condition information for--the reference person and spouse. Specifically, I modeled the probability of having each health condition based on age, gender, and race using the health outcomes for the head of household and spouse. I then used this model to predict health conditions for everyone else in the household.^[My code is here if you're curious about the details. Since there are so few covariates available for other household members in the PSID, I don't think there can be much value added in any particular approach.]
<!-- Need to add link! -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This imputation approach suffers from a few problems. One issue is that it's possible that people who aren't a head of household or spouse have systematically better or worse health even after adjusting for gender, race and age. 
<!-- While this is possible, it's probably not a huge issue. For instance, people who have really debilitating health conditions may be systematically less likely to be "head of household or spouse" but the most common health conditions are very common and not that debilitating. -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more serious problem is that health conditions are correlated within households. For instance, if a family member has heart disease, you're more likely to have heart disease then what would be predicted based on just your age, gender, and race. My imputation approach predicts health conditions based on age gender and race, so this within household correlation is a big problem that I cannot account for.^[While I technically could try to add some kind of within household correlation to my imputation model, it would be a totally made up number. To estimate the household level correlation in health conditions I would need data that has health conditions of all members of the household/family.] 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family level correlation of health conditions causes me to overestimate how many people have a health condition in the household. (At least that's my confident guess, I don't actually have data to prove it.) Age, gender, and race are not very predictive of most health conditions. This means my predictions, while close to correct in the aggregate, will give most people a medium percentage chance of having any given condition. When aggregating across multiple individuals in a family, this means family level risk for at least one person having a given condition will be relatively high. In reality, the distribution of health conditions is more tail heavy, with many households that very healthy and a smaller fraction that have a lot of health conditions. Preicting health based on age, gender, and race does not account for the fact that health vulnerabilities are concentrated within families, for environmental, social, and genetic reasons. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tl;dr Health problems are correlated within families, so estimating health problems based on demographics make them look more diffuse across families reality, which (maybe counter intuitively) makes my estimates of household level health issues too pessimistic. Fewer families have any given health condition, but families that do have at least one health condition are likely to have multiple conditions. 

## Results

With those huge caveats in mind, the graph below plots that chance any given individual is in a household where at least one family member has a given condition. As you can see, the probability of having someone in the faily with at least one health condition is quite high by this estimate, but it is almost certainly an overestimate. 

```{r hh_risk, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only number that is not going to suffer from within-household correlation in health is the probability of having someone above age 65 in your household. I might break that down further in a future post, but the race differences were quite striking to me, and the opposite of what I expected.
